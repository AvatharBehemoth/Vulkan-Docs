The workings of vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR are unclearly described. 
As is VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR 
  * VkExtent2D                        currentExtent;
    VkExtent2D                       minImageExtent;
    VkExtent2D                       maxImageExtent; 
    In Several API's there are calls to return the width and height of the window opened in the os. for use in resizing the window/surface dimensions.
    This seemed not to be present in Vulkan. Yet frameworks like SDL2 (SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize) had that capability as has OpenGL (glfwSetFramebufferSizeCallback).
    
    after quite some research https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59620313/how-is-the-size-of-a-surface-determined-in-vulkan answered the question.
    The VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR struct has the extent members which seem to be continuously updated in the currentExtent.height and currentExtent.width. 
    Please include that information in the Vulkan manual, it is information which new users should be able to find easily, yet now they cant. 
    Because its not in the documentation
    
    Please note this is the first time i have opened an issue (at the request of Lunarg itself btw)
